/*
	Created by WangWeishuai.
	This compiler-project was started at April and it is too long till now.
	There are so many horrrrrrrible Errors (I think it is from linking when two hpp files contains each other),
	so it may looks not very elegant because some functions or methods can't work well but after changing a way to 
	express it which I think it is exactly the same as the first one I write before,
	(or just change a place to put some funcs), it runs miraculously:)
	I donâ€™t want to explore the reason, because too long has passed and I can't remenber them:)
	Fortunately, Nearly all cases are solved correctly.
	I AM TOO VEGETABLE:)
